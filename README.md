# IPL Cricket Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that provides interactive visualizations and statistical insights into the Indian Premier League (IPL) using a dataset of player and match statistics. It allows users to analyze player performance, team statistics, match details, and identify the top performers in categories like best bowler and best all-rounder.

## Features

- **Player Stats Analysis**: Select a player from the sidebar to view their season-wise performance including runs, wickets, strike rate, and more. Visualizations highlight their contribution in terms of runs and wickets across seasons.
  
- **Match Stats Analysis**: Analyze match-wise team statistics by selecting a specific match. A pie chart displays the run distribution between teams.

- **Best Bowler**: Identify the top-performing bowler in the IPL based on total wickets taken. A bar chart showcases the player's wickets across seasons.

- **Best All-Rounder**: Analyze the top all-rounder in IPL history based on a custom all-rounder score (runs and wickets combined). Line charts visualize the player's performance in terms of runs and wickets.

- **Team Performance**: Select a team to analyze their performance over the seasons. A combined bar and line chart display the team's total runs and wickets for each season.
